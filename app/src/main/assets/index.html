        <h2>How TravelBud Works</h2>
        <p>
          The app allows you to keep track of all your planned trips, with a
          clean, user friendly and intuitive design. You are able to enter
          specific details about your trip, such as the destination, the date of
          travel, accommodation, budget and so on. For each trip, you can also
          enter details about the activities you will do each day of your trip.
          This app also provides users with a checklist on what you need to do
          before you travel allowing you to easily keep track of this. This app
          therefore helps you adequately prepare for your next trip. It also
          removes the hassle of keeping track of trip requirements.
        </p>

        <h2 id = "start-up-page">Start up page</h2>
        <p>
          On start-up, you will be prompted to set up the app by entering your
          name and country of residence. This information will be stored in
          local storage and can be accessed and edited at any time from your
          settings.
        </p>

        <h2 id="home-page">Home page</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have set up the app, you will be taken to the home page,
          where you can see all your trips. This page shows trip information
          such as the trip name and trip dates. You can also add a new trip by
          clicking on the "Add Trip" button shown as a '+' button on the bottom
          right of the screen (see image for reference).
        </p>

        <h2 id="add-trip-page">Add trip page</h2>
        <p>
          Once you click on the add trip button, you will be taken to a page
          where you can add trips. From there you can go on to create trips, and
          add the details about each trip, which will then be stored in local
          storage. Please see image for reference.
        </p>

        <h2 id="trip-details-page">Trip details page</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have added a trip, you will be taken back to the home page
          where you can see the trip you have just added. You can click on the
          view trip details button trip to view the details of the trip. This
          takes you to a page where you can see all the details of the trip. And
          it includes a checklist for the trip, which is all the things you need
          to do before you travel. On this page, you can also share the trip
          details with other users which allows you to inform them that you are
          leaving on that particular trip. You can also click view destination
          on map which opens google maps and shows you the location of the
          destination. You can also click view trip plans button which would
          take you to a page where you can see all the activities you have
          planned for that trip. At the bottom of the page, there is a button that
          allows you to delete the trip. This page requires internet to get the complete
          functionality out of it and be able to save the trip checklist and
          trip plans from the trip plan page as well. The page also shows an image
          of the destination country.
        </p>

        <h2 id="trip-plans-page">Trip plans page</h2>
        <p>
          On the Trip plans, you can add and delete trip plans for the trip.
          Clicking and holding a trip plan will delete it from the list. These
          trip plan details are stored using Firebase and therefore will require
          the user to connect to the internet at some point to be able to save
          the trip plans. However, Firebase does keep the changes in cache and
          will save them later if an internet connection is not currently
          available.

        <h2 id="settings-page">Settings page</h2>
        <p>
          Back on the home screen, there is a menu where you can access the
          settings page, this user guide and share information about the app
          with other users. On the settings page, you can edit your name and
          country of residence. This information is stored in local storage
          using shared preferences and can be accessed at any time. The share
          button allows you to share information about the app with other users
          in different ways. Please see images below to see how this menu and
          the settings page look.
